# pewlett-hackard-analysis

## **OVERVIEW**

This analysis was prepared for Pewlett Hackard (PH) to assist with workforce-planning, as the company prepares for a significant number of retirements over the next few years. 

An employee database was created and used to identify the employees eligible for retirement, by title, as well as those that would be able to provide mentorship to their successors. In doing so, PH can best prepare for future staffing needs, and determine a strategy for providing effective onboarding and knowledge transfer resources, to new hires. 

Ideally, this is to be completed before the "silver tsunami" makes landfall.
